# Selective Silence

[DEPRECATED AND NOT MAINTAINED ANYMORE. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS FORWARD, ADD CALL LOGS PERMISSION AND AND REPLICATE RIGNTONE MANUALLY ON API >= 23	]

An app to **NOT** miss important calls while coding

![Selective Silence](https://i.ibb.co/LvdMwRB/screenshot-github.png)

## Motivation

I have a bad habit of putting my phone on vibrate while coding and forgetting to revert thereafter, which makes me miss calls from dad. So I made an app that'd make my phone ring even if it's on vibrate when the call is from selected people and put it back to vibrate after the call is hung up.

## Usage

The app is straight forward and presented without decorations, just allow Phone and Contacts permissions, add contacts you'd like to and turn the switch on.
